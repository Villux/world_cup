Motivation behind this master's thesis is to experiment how accurately an outcome of a football match in World cup can be predicted using free data from the internet, and is it possible to create a profitable betting strategy for the tournament.

Football, being one of the biggest sports in the world, attracts lot of global attention especially during the main tournaments like FIFA World Cup and EURO. This global interest has attracted big investment banks like Goldman Sachs and UBS to predict tournament outcome. Also, the research community has been active around this topic; mostly predicting the probabilities for winning the tournament or predicting the most probable course of the tournament \cite{groll2018prediction}, \cite{groll2015prediction}, \cite{leitner2010forecasting}.

For many betting the outcome of a match is as important part as watching the game. No wonder that the size of the betting industry is massive. This must be one the reason why the field of economics has actively research this industry, especially the efficiency of the betting market. This efficient market hypothesis (EMH), originally presented by CITE state that all the available information is reflect in the prices and there is no change to "beat the market". EMH of betting market has been discarded by \cite{vlastakis2009efficient}, even the weak-form of efficient market hypothesis. Even though betting markets are not efficient general assumption is that probabilities given by betting industry are close to the true probabilities. For this reason models are benchmarked against the odds given by betting industry and available odds are used as features in the model \cite{leitner2010forecasting}. Kuypers \cite{kuypers2008} has heavily claims against the believe that the betting market consensus is close to the true probabilities. If bookmaker wants to increase its profits while keeping its over-roundness competitive it needs set the odds further from the market efficient odds. Also, marketing purposes and heavy one-sided bets can lead to inefficient odds. In the case of heavy one-sided bets bookmaker exposes itself to higher risk exposure if match's outcome is the one that is bet very heavily. Knowing the unique dynamic of betting markets and the increased betting activities during big tournaments like FIFA World Cup leads naturally to a question: is it possible to earn profit from betting FIFA World Cup matches?

As far as I know this opportunity to bet profitably on FIFA World Cup has not been researched. For this reason one of the main goals of this master's thesis is to investigate if it's possible to create a profitable betting strategy for FIFA World Cup.

Nowadays, data is collected extensively from different sports. For long data collection in football was limited compared to other sports like basketball, but now many different sources for data exists. Unfortunate part is, that the data is very expensive and only part of it is freely available. Free data mostly contains historical matches. Fortunately many games that simulate football have vast collection of player and team-level attribute data. This data is freely available and to my knowledge hasn't been used only once \cite{shin2014novel}. The second goal of this master's thesis is to see if this freely available data, player attribute data and match history data, can be used to predict the tournaments more accurately than the betting market predicts.

The rest of the thesis is structured as follows: in Literature review.... Next in Section 3 I describe the dataset and how player attributes are aggregated to team-level attributes. Then, in Section 4, I describe the prediction models, betting strategies and the tournament simulation process. In Section 5 results from the simulation experiments are stated. Finally I conclude and discuss about future work in Section 6.
